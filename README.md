## options

- **font size** (4px - 32px, 20px default)
- **fonts** (from google)
    - Azeret Mono
    - Cousine
    - DM Mono
    - Fira Code (default)
    - JetBrains Mono
    - Roboto Mono
    - Source Code Pro
- **themes**
    - Gruvbox Dark Hard
    - **NOTE:** there is only one theme right now. this is because i am lazy also because leetcode's syntax recognition is weird and it's never a 1:1 port from whatever theme usually which demotivates me. if you want to add a theme, do it yourself and make a pull rq
